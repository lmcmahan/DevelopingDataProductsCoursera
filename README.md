Coursera Course: Developing Data Products
==============================

## Introduction
This repository is created for the final project of the 'Developing Data Product' Coursera course.  The repository consists of three final project submission files:
- ui.R
- server.R
- README.md 

The ui.R and server.R are the code I have written for the final project shiny application named **Iris Species Prediction**. Following are the final project submission links of my iris species prediction shiny application and RStudio presentation slides:

- The shiny application is deployed on ShinyApps.io server at: [http://lmcmahan.shinyapps.io/project](http://lmcmahan.shinyapps.io/project)
- The RStudio presentation slides is published to RPubs at: [http://rpubs.com/mcmahan/50120
